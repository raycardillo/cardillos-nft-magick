Contributing
============

Get in touch if you're interested in contributing, but you would need to sign a [Contributor License Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) before any contributions could be considered.

More generally, you agree that any contributions or correspondence are donated to this project's maintainers. If you don't agree to that then do not communicate with us or submit any code. However, that's not sufficient to protect the open source license when more significant contributions are submitted as Pull Requests, etc.
